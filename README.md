## How to Play?
The rules are the same as classic Tic-Tac-Toe:

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. You are **"X"** and the AI opponent is **"O"**.
3. Players take turns placing their marks in an empty square.
4. The first player to get three on their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
5. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
